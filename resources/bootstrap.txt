*bootstrap.min.js*

minified ONLY carousel and transition files from bootstrap3

does not include any other of the other jQuery bootstrap plugins

if you want to compile your own or update this version you need to go to:
http://getbootstrap.com/customize/

as a minimum you need under jQuery functionality - Carousel functionality and Transitions


*carousel.css*

minified carousel.css crunched with http://crunchapp.net/
based on carousel.less, mixins.less and variables.less
originally from bootstrap but modified versions can be found at:
https://github.com/heleneross/Weather_Bootstrapped/tree/master/less
 
you can use the customise page (see above) and select just carousel under less
this will create a css file twice the size however
